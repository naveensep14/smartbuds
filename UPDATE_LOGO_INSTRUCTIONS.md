# Logo Update Instructions

## Step 1: Save Your Logo

1. **Save the graduation cap character image** (the 3D render you provided) to:
   ```
   /Users/Naveen.Gowda@cruxinformatics.com/Documents/Personal/SmartBuds/public/images/logo-square.jpg
   ```

2. **Important:** Make sure to:
   - Save it as **JPG format** (not WebP or PNG)
   - Name it exactly: `logo-square.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - This will replace the old logo with text

## Step 2: After Saving

Once you've saved the image, run this command to update all references:

```bash
# This will be done automatically by the update script below
```

## Files That Will Be Updated

The logo appears in these files (will be updated to use local file):
- `components/NavigationHeader.tsx`
- `app/login/page.tsx`
- `app/signup/page.tsx`
- `app/results/page.tsx`
- `app/my-results/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/page.tsx`
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `public/manifest.json`

## Current vs New

**Current:** Using external URL `https://i.ibb.co/6RcwZjJr/logo-square.jpg`
**New:** Will use local file `/images/logo-square.jpg`

This improves:
- ✅ Faster loading (local file)
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Better control over the image
- ✅ Your new branding without text overlay
