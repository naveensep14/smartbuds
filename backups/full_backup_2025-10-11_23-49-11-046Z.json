            "question": "If you start at (0,0) on a grid and move 4 steps to the right and then 3 steps up, what are your new coordinates?",
            "explanation": "Moving 4 steps to the right changes the first number (x-coordinate) to 4. Moving 3 steps up changes the second number (y-coordinate) to 3. So, the new coordinates are (4, 3).",

            "question": "A treasure is hidden at coordinates (5, 2) on a map grid. What does this specifically mean from a starting point of (0,0)?",
            "explanation": "The first number in coordinates (x, y) tells you to move horizontally (right for positive numbers), and the second number tells you to move vertically (up for positive numbers). So, (5, 2) means 5 steps right and 2 steps up.",

            "question": "On a grid, if you are at a point and you move towards the South, which part of your coordinate pair is decreasing?",
            "explanation": "Moving South on a grid is the same as moving downwards. This decreases the vertical position, which is represented by the second number (y-coordinate) in the pair.",

            "question": "A cat is at (6, 5) and its bowl of milk is at (6, 2). In which cardinal direction should the cat move to reach its milk, assuming it only moves along grid lines?",
            "explanation": "The first number (6) for both coordinates is the same, meaning there's no horizontal (East or West) movement needed. The second number (vertical position) changes from 5 to 2. To go from 5 down to 2, the cat needs to move downwards, which is the South direction.",

            "explanation": "To find the distance, count the steps:\n- From Squirrel (2, 3) to Nut Pile A (5, 3): The horizontal distance is |5 - 2| = 3 steps. The vertical distance is 0 steps. Total distance = 3 steps.\n- From Squirrel (2, 3) to Nut Pile B (2, 5): The horizontal distance is 0 steps. The vertical distance is |5 - 3| = 2 steps. Total distance = 2 steps.\nSince 2 steps is less than 3 steps, Nut Pile B is closer.",

            "explanation": "First, find the total milk used: 1 l 500 ml + 2 l 300 ml = (1+2) l + (500+300) ml = 3 l 800 ml. Next, subtract the used milk from the total bought: 4 l - 3 l 800 ml. To subtract easily, think of 4 l as 3 l 1000 ml. So, 3 l 1000 ml - 3 l 800 ml = 200 ml. 1 liter is 1,000 ml, and 200 ml is less than 1,000 ml. Therefore, 200 ml is left, which is less than 1 liter.",

            "question": "Why do regular octagons NOT tessellate a flat surface without gaps or overlaps, unlike squares or equilateral triangles?",
            "explanation": "For shapes to tessellate, the sum of their interior angles meeting at a single point must be exactly 360 degrees. Regular octagons have interior angles of 135 degrees. If you try to fit them, two octagons would be 270 degrees, leaving a 90-degree gap. Three octagons would be 405 degrees, causing an overlap.",

            "explanation": "Row A's repeating unit is '2 over, 1 under'. Row B's repeating unit is '1 under, 2 over'. This shows that Row B starts with 'under' (1 under) while Row A starts with 'over' (2 over), and the counts of 'over' and 'under' within the repeating unit are swapped.",

            "explanation": "When you stretch a shape into a long, thin form while keeping the same area, the total length of its boundary (perimeter) usually increases because the two long sides become much longer, even if the short sides become much shorter. For example, a 4x4 square has Area=16 and Perimeter=16. A 16x1 rectangle has Area=16 but Perimeter=34.",

If we multiply 1/4 by 2/2, we get 2/8. This means the cheese is divided into 8 pieces, and 2 of those pieces are used, which is the same amount as 1 out of 4 pieces.",

            "explanation": "You ate 2 out of 6 squares, which is the fraction 2/6. To find a simpler equivalent fraction, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. So, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 6 divided by 2 is 3.

Here, if you multiply both the numerator (3) and the denominator (5) of 3/5 by 2, you get 6/10. This shows that the proportion of the pizza is the same, just divided into more, smaller pieces (10 instead of 5).",

            "explanation": "If a shape has rotational symmetry at a half turn, it means it looks the same at its starting position (0 turn) and again after a 1/2 turn. After another 1/2 turn (making a full turn), it returns to its starting position. So, it looks the same 2 times (at 0 and 1/2 turn) within a full rotation, counting the starting position.",

            "explanation": "If a design looks the same after a 1/3 turn, it means it has an order of rotational symmetry of 3. It will look the same at its starting position (0 turn), after 1/3 turn, and again after 2/3 turn. After 3/3 (a full turn), it's back to the start.

            "explanation": "A regular square has rotational symmetry of order 4. This means it looks the same at 1/4 turn, 2/4 (1/2) turn, 3/4 turn, and 4/4 (full) turn. A 1/8 turn is not one of these specific rotation amounts where a square would perfectly align with its original appearance.",
