# SuccessBuds Data Backups

This directory contains automated backups of your SuccessBuds Supabase data.

## Backup Files

### Latest Backup
- `latest_backup.json` - Always contains the most recent backup data

### Timestamped Backups
- `successbuds_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Combined backup with all data
- `tests_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Tests table backup only
- `results_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Results table backup only

## Backup Contents

Each backup includes:
- **Tests**: All test data including questions, options, and metadata
- **Results**: Student test results and scores
- **Metadata**: Backup timestamp, table counts, and source information

## How to Restore

### From Latest Backup
```bash
# Use the restore script
node scripts/restore-supabase.js latest_backup.json
```

### From Specific Backup
```bash
# Use a specific timestamped backup
node scripts/restore-supabase.js successbuds_backup_2025-10-03.json
```

## Backup Schedule

**Manual Backup:**
```bash
node scripts/backup-supabase.js
```

**Automated Backup (recommended):**
Set up a cron job or GitHub Actions to run weekly backups.

## Data Safety

- âœ… All data is exported in JSON format
- âœ… Backups include full test questions and student results
- âœ… Metadata preserved (timestamps, IDs, etc.)
- âœ… Human-readable format for easy inspection
- âœ… Stored locally in your repository

## Important Notes

- Backups are stored in this repository for version control
- Keep backups secure and don't commit sensitive student data to public repos
- Consider encrypting backups for additional security
- Test restore procedures regularly

1. Connects to your Supabase database
2. Exports all tables (tests, results)
3. Creates multiple backup formats
4. Updates the latest backup file
5. Provides detailed logging
