        "question": "Why can we say that 1/2 is the same as 2/4?",
        "explanation": "The fractions 1/2 and 2/4 represent the same amount of a whole. If you have half of something (1/2), and then you cut that half into two smaller, equal pieces, you now have two pieces, but it's still the same total amount you started with, which would be 2/4 of the whole.",

        "explanation": "When reflected horizontally, the letters M and O remain the same. Therefore, the word 'MOM' would look the same in a mirror placed underneath it. Letters like T, P, B, E, D, X do not all retain their original form when reflected horizontally, making words like TOP, BED, and BOX not perfectly symmetrical in this way.",

        "explanation": "Using different units allows us to express measurements in convenient and precise numbers. Metres are practical for large objects (like a room or playground), avoiding very large numbers of centimetres. Centimetres provide enough detail and accuracy for smaller objects (like a pencil or book), avoiding tiny fractions of a metre.",

Add that 1 ten (10 ones) to the 2 ones, making it 12 ones. Now subtract 12 - 7 = 5. Then, subtract the tens: 4 - 2 = 2. So, 52 - 27 = 25 balloons were left.",

        "explanation": "This is a subtraction problem: 43 - 19. Start with the ones place. You cannot take 9 from 3, so you regroup. Take 1 ten from the 4 tens, leaving 3 tens. Add that 1 ten (10 ones) to the 3 ones, making it 13 ones. Now subtract 13 - 9 = 4. Then, subtract the tens: 3 - 1 = 2. So, 43 - 19 = 24 apple trees are left.",

        ],
        "question": "Why is regrouping (borrowing) important when subtracting two-digit numbers like 34 from 62?",
        "explanation": "Regrouping is important because it allows you to subtract in the ones column when the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit. By taking a ten from the tens place and adding it to the ones place (making 10 ones), you create a larger ones digit that you can subtract from. Without regrouping, you would not be able to complete the subtraction correctly in that column.",

        "explanation": "First, find the total milk used: 1 l 500 ml + 2 l 300 ml = (1+2) l + (500+300) ml = 3 l 800 ml. Next, subtract the used milk from the total bought: 4 l - 3 l 800 ml. To subtract easily, think of 4 l as 3 l 1000 ml. So, 3 l 1000 ml - 3 l 800 ml = 200 ml. 1 liter is 1,000 ml, and 200 ml is less than 1,000 ml. Therefore, 200 ml is left, which is less than 1 liter.",

        "explanation": "Row A's repeating unit is '2 over, 1 under'. Row B's repeating unit is '1 under, 2 over'. This shows that Row B starts with 'under' (1 under) while Row A starts with 'over' (2 over), and the counts of 'over' and 'under' within the repeating unit are swapped.",

        "explanation": "A scale where one picture equals 5 books (e.g., 60/5=12 pictures, 90/5=18 pictures, 45/5=9 pictures) allows the data to be represented by whole, manageable numbers of pictures, making the pictograph clear and easy to interpret. A scale of 1 would require too many pictures, and a scale of 10 would make 45 difficult to represent as a whole picture, while 50 would be too large.",

We need to borrow from the tens and hundreds places. 2700 - 1083. \n- Ones: 0 - 3 (borrow from tens) becomes 10 - 3 = 7.\n- Tens: The 0 in tens became 9 (after borrowing from hundreds), so 9 - 8 = 1.\n- Hundreds: The 7 in hundreds became 6, so 6 - 0 = 6.\n- Thousands: 2 - 1 = 1.\nSo, the difference is 1,617.",

        "explanation": "Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. This means they undo each other. If you add two numbers to get a sum (like 45 + 20 = 65), then subtracting one of those numbers from the sum will give you the other number. So, 65 - 45 will equal 20, and 65 - 20 will equal 45.",

Now, calculate the area: Plot A Area = 10 m × 5 m = 50 square meters. Plot B Area = 12 m × 3 m = 36 square meters. Plot A has a larger area. This shows that shapes can have the same perimeter but different areas.",

        "question": "Imagine you have a square piece of paper. If you cut it and rearrange the pieces to make a very long, thin rectangle, what would most likely happen to its perimeter while keeping the area the same?",
        "explanation": "When you stretch a shape into a long, thin form while keeping the same area, the total length of its boundary (perimeter) usually increases because the two long sides become much longer, even if the short sides become much shorter. For example, a 4x4 square has Area=16 and Perimeter=16. A 16x1 rectangle has Area=16 but Perimeter=34.",

        "explanation": "Start with 06:15 hours. Add 4 hours: 06:15 + 4:00 = 10:15 hours. Now add 50 minutes: 10:15 + 0:45 takes us to 11:00 hours (60 minutes in an hour, so 15+45=60). You have 5 minutes left from the 50 (50-45=5). So, the time is 11:00 + 0:05 = 11:05 hours. Since 11:05 hours is before 12:00 hours, it is 11:05 AM in 12-hour format.",

        ],
        "question": "Which of these fractions is NOT equivalent to 1/2?",
        "explanation": "To check for equivalence to 1/2, you can see if the numerator is half of the denominator. For 2/4, 2 is half of 4. For 3/6, 3 is half of 6. For 4/8, 4 is half of 8. For 5/9, 5 is not half of 9 (which would be 4.5). So, 5/9 is not equivalent to 1/2.",

        "question": "Which pair of fractions are equivalent?",
        "explanation": "Let's check each option. For 1/3 and 3/6: 3/6 simplifies to 1/2, so they are not equivalent. For 2/5 and 4/10: If you multiply 2/5 by 2/2, you get 4/10, so they are equivalent. For 1/4 and 2/6: 2/6 simplifies to 1/3, not 1/4. For 3/7 and 6/10: These are not equivalent (3/7 can't be easily converted to 6/10 by multiplying by a whole number).",

        "question": "A chef uses 1/4 of a block of cheese. Which of the following fractions represents the same amount of cheese used, but shows it divided into more pieces?",
        "explanation": "The original fraction is 1/4. To show it divided into more pieces, you need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number. If we multiply 1/4 by 2/2, we get 2/8. This means the cheese is divided into 8 pieces, and 2 of those pieces are used, which is the same amount as 1 out of 4 pieces.",

        "question": "If you have a chocolate bar divided into 6 equal squares, and you eat 2 of those squares, which statement correctly describes the amount of chocolate you ate using an equivalent fraction?",
        "explanation": "You ate 2 out of 6 squares, which is the fraction 2/6. To find a simpler equivalent fraction, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. So, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 6 divided by 2 is 3. This means 2/6 is equivalent to 1/3.",

        "explanation": "Tamanna is correct because equivalent fractions represent the same amount, even if they have different numbers. Here, if you multiply both the numerator (3) and the denominator (5) of 3/5 by 2, you get 6/10. This shows that the proportion of the pizza is the same, just divided into more, smaller pieces (10 instead of 5).",

        "explanation": "If a design looks the same after a 1/3 turn, it means it has an order of rotational symmetry of 3. It will look the same at its starting position (0 turn), after 1/3 turn, and again after 2/3 turn. After 3/3 (a full turn), it's back to the start.

        "question": "A regular square has rotational symmetry. At which of these turns will a regular square *not* look exactly the same as its original position?",
        "explanation": "A regular square has rotational symmetry of order 4. This means it looks the same at 1/4 turn, 2/4 (1/2) turn, 3/4 turn, and 4/4 (full) turn. A 1/8 turn is not one of these specific rotation amounts where a square would perfectly align with its original appearance.",
