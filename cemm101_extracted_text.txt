A long long time ago, there was a 
cowherd family in Tarakeshwar. Every 
day Deba and Deep took the cows out for 
grazing. They used to return in the late 
evening together with all the cows.
One day, Deba asked: How do we know 
that we have not lost any cows? They did 
not know how to count.
What could Deba and Deep do?
Did all the cows come back home?
Their friend gave them an idea: When you 
 
 go out, 
make a mark on the wall for 
 each cow that leaves the gate. Then  
     when you come back, strike out one
 
  
  mark 
from the wall each time a 
 
    cow re-enters the gate.
What's in a What's in a 
Name?Name?11
The next day they followed 
their friend’s idea, and all the 
marks were struck out when 
they came back home.

After a few years, they 
had many more cows. One 
day, their wall had this 
many marks when they left 
home.
So, they had 
.......... cows.
The next day they returned 
with the cows. They struck 
out one mark as each cow 
re-entered the gate. Two marks were still left on the wall but they 
didn’t see any cows outside. They were worried.
Why were Deba and Deep worried?
How many cows had reached home? .............................. 
Deba and Deep quickly went to search for the missing cows and 
found them in a nearby field. They all happily returned home 
together!
Their friend Hemant had 36 cows and 23 sheep. 
Help Hemant keep track of his cows and sheep by making marks like 
Deba and Deep.
Teacher’s Note: Encourage children to think of different strategies 
to count large groups of objects without using numbers. They can 
also use the above story as an activity where they can keep track of 
all children entering and leaving the classroom.
