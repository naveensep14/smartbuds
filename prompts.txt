# Test Generation Prompts

## üéØ **Prompt for Generating Multiple Tests per Chapter:**

```
I need you to generate tests for Class 3 Math chapters 2-14 based on PDF files in the /tmp folder. 

Requirements:
- Generate 3 tests per chapter
- Each test should have 10 questions
- Each question should have 4 multiple choice options
- Include detailed explanations for each answer
- Set board to "CBSE" and grade to "Class 3"
- Duration should be 30 minutes per test
- Save individual JSON files for each chapter (containing all 3 tests)
- Also create a combined JSON file with all tests

The PDF files are named: cemm102.pdf, cemm103.pdf, cemm104.pdf, etc. (through cemm114.pdf)

Please create a Python script that:
1. Extracts text from each PDF
2. Generates 3 comprehensive tests per chapter
3. Creates realistic questions based on the chapter content
4. Saves the results in JSON format
5. Provides a summary of what was generated

Expected output:
- 13 chapters √ó 3 tests = 39 total tests
- 39 tests √ó 10 questions = 390 total questions
- Individual chapter files and one combined file
```

## üîß **Alternative Shorter Prompt:**

```
Generate Class 3 Math tests from PDFs in /tmp folder:
- Create tests based concepts within the chapters
- 10 questions per test based on pdf content per every concept
- 4 options per question
- CBSE board, Class 3 grade
- 30 minutes duration
- Save as JSON files
- Include explanations
- Avoid duplicate questions

PDFs: cemm102.pdf through cemm114.pdf

## üìù **Key Elements to Include:**

1. **Specific requirements** (3 tests, 10 questions, etc.)
2. **File locations** (/tmp folder, PDF naming pattern)
3. **Output format** (JSON files)
4. **Test specifications** (board, grade, duration)
5. **Expected deliverables** (individual + combined files)
6. **Content requirements** (explanations, realistic questions)

## üéØ **General Test Generation Prompt Template:**

```
Generate [SUBJECT] tests for [GRADE] based on [SOURCE]:

Requirements:
- Generate [X] tests per [UNIT/CHAPTER]
- Each test should have [Y] questions
- Each question should have [Z] multiple choice options
- Include detailed explanations for each answer
- Set board to "[BOARD]" and grade to "[GRADE]"
- Duration should be [TIME] minutes per test
- Save individual JSON files for each [UNIT/CHAPTER]
- Also create a combined JSON file with all tests

Source files: [FILE_PATTERN]

Please create a Python script that:
1. Extracts content from source files
2. Generates comprehensive tests per unit
3. Creates realistic questions based on the content
4. Saves the results in JSON format
5. Provides a summary of what was generated

Expected output:
- [UNITS] √ó [TESTS_PER_UNIT] = [TOTAL_TESTS] tests
- [TOTAL_TESTS] √ó [QUESTIONS_PER_TEST] = [TOTAL_QUESTIONS] questions
- Individual unit files and one combined file
```

## üìã **Usage Examples:**

### For Grade 4 Science:
```
Generate Grade 4 Science tests from PDFs in /tmp folder:
- 2 tests per chapter (chapters 1-8)
- 8 questions per test
- 4 options per question
- CBSE board, Grade 4
- 25 minutes duration
- Save as JSON files
- Include explanations

PDFs: science_chapter_1.pdf through science_chapter_8.pdf
```

### For Class 5 English:
```
Generate Class 5 English tests from text files in /chapters folder:
- 4 tests per chapter (chapters 1-10)
- 15 questions per test
- 4 options per question
- CBSE board, Class 5
- 45 minutes duration
- Save as JSON files
- Include explanations

Files: english_ch1.txt through english_ch10.txt
```
